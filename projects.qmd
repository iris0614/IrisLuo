- **Description**: A project that involved key steps such as performing the ETL process and data cleaning in PostgreSQL, followed by data transformations and creating enhanced visualizations in Tableau. We then built and evaluated various machine learning models, including KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, RBF SVM, and Logistic Regression, in Jupyter Notebook. After conducting thorough EDA, we selected the best model to make predictions and present the results.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Tableau, Altair, Matplotlib, Plotly, PyTorch, Seaborn, Pandas, NumPy
